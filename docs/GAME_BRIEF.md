# Game brief: the playable client

Started with the user on 2026-11-08. This is a design target and decision log, not an implementation report. Implementation evidence goes in [current state](CURRENT_STATE.md) and the [stage log](STAGES.md).

Until now every client served the simulation lab: the [living observer](../living/viewer) shows experiment worlds and cannot control anyone. This brief covers a separate product: a game humans actually play, built from scratch.

## Lab and game — decided

| | Simulation lab | Game |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | experiments on behavior, society and scale | a world people play in |
| Code | shared core: [`living/rules`](../living/rules) and [`living/authority`](../living/authority) | the same core |
| Own parts | seeds, lab tools, the observer, throwaway worlds | its setting and seed, its client (`living/game`), its database and deployment |
| Pace of change | moves fast on `main` | runs a released core version |

Findings move from the lab to the game when a core version is released and the game world is updated to it. A persistent game world is never reset, so every core update the game takes must be a valid in-place update of a live module. Game-specific behavior lives in the seed and config (seeds already carry a `rules` block), never in a fork of the core.

## Player experience — decided

- **A 3D world in Bevy, desktop first.** Other platforms may come later. The simulation stays a flat tile plane; the client renders it in 3D.
- **ARPG-style camera.** Isometric or top-down, as in League of Legends, Supervive and Path of Exile, tweaked for the genre. No first person, and no free 360° orbiting camera.
- **Interactive combat** with both targeted skills and aimed skillshots.
- **Proximity chat.** Players type free text. Only characters within earshot hear it, which the authority already enforces (`perceive::speak`).
- **Many human players.** No fixed number: as many as the core can support. This makes the scale gates of the [performance contract](PERFORMANCE_CONTRACT.md) game requirements.
- **The world continues offline.** When a player leaves, their character keeps living under an AI mind. That mind's behavior should come from how the player actually played, so the character stays recognizably theirs. A custom external mind supplied by the player is a later option.
- **Running cost** of model calls is set aside for now.

## Open questions, with recommended defaults

| Question | Recommended default | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Which setting ships? | A new game seed built with the authored-world tools; Aske Coast as the first test world | The [world vision](WORLD_VISION.md) setting (AI factions, gods, ascension) needs mechanics the core doesn't have yet |
| Core loop | Arrive as a stranger, find food and shelter, earn a place in a community by working, trading and talking; status and conflict follow | Every part already exists in the core: needs, communities, offices, graded force |
| Joining | Arrive at the edge of a settlement and ask to join (`community`, `membership`, `join_request` exist) | Being born is too slow at a playable pace |
| Death | Permanent, as agreed. The player sees how they died and who saw it, then arrives as a new stranger with nothing inherited | Follows [world vision](WORLD_VISION.md) mortality |
| World pace | Slower than labs (labs run about 5 game days per real hour); set per seed with `life_pace` and `year_days` | To decide by play-testing |
| Camera details | One fixed angle, rotation in 45° steps or none, scroll zoom within limits | The camera spike below compares presets |
| Movement | WASD relative to the camera, plus click-to-move (`goto` to a point) | Matches the chosen genre |

## Core work the game needs (engine-independent)

1. **Perception-scoped data.** Almost every table is public today, including other characters' `experience`, `thought`, `belief` and `persona`. A player must receive only what their character can perceive and remember:
   - shared views by map region for the physical world (`body`, `structure`, `resource_node` and `terrain_chunk` are already indexed by 16×16-tile chunk);
   - per-player views keyed on the caller for private state;
   - mind tables made private, with a separate developer path for the observer.
2. **A typed player API.** `human_act` takes behavior-graph JSON. The game needs typed actions, aim directions and the projectile or area mechanics that skillshots require.
3. **Controller handoff.** Move a character between the player and a mind on disconnect and reconnect. Today `mind_*` reducers authorize by `character.controller`.
4. **A mind learned from play.** The player's own experiences and choices must be consolidated into the persona and routines the offline mind uses.
5. **Joining, death and rejoining** as above.
6. **Measured input latency.** The contract asks for ≤150 ms p95 from input to authoritative outcome at 80 ms round trip. It is unmeasured for human input on the living core. Client-side prediction can reuse the same steering code the authority runs (`living_rules::steer`).

## Engine — decided: Bevy

How easily an agent can build, verify and iterate decided it:

- **Bevy:** everything is Rust code, buildable and testable from the command line. It shares the rules crate with the authority (prediction without a second simulator), and it shares bindings and verification harnesses with the core.
- **Unity:** scenes and prefabs are fragile to edit as text, and headless builds need license activation.
- **Unreal:** Blueprints are binary, and builds are slow and very large.

Bevy's gaps are filled with our own code: game UI widgets (egui only for developer tools), editor-like tooling as in-game debug panels and data files, and art made in Blender and exported as glTF. Unity remains the fallback if art or animation needs outgrow this.

## SpacetimeDB documentation consulted (2026-11-08)

Pinned versions: module, SDK and server `2.10.1`.

- [Client SDKs](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/clients): official SDKs exist for Rust, C# (also used for Unity), TypeScript and Unreal (C++ and Blueprint). The pages read give no maturity labels.
- [Views](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/functions/views/):
  - Views can filter per caller (`ctx.sender`), and clients subscribe to them like tables. Each per-user view is computed separately for every subscriber, while anonymous views are shared.
  - Views may only use indexed lookups.
  - The page recommends region-based design: clients subscribe to shared regions instead of per-user "what's near me" queries.
  - **Implication:** the physical world goes through shared, chunk-keyed data, and only private state goes through per-player views. Fog of war still has to be enforced by what the authority puts in those views.
- [Subscriptions](https://spacetimedb.com/docs/clients/subscriptions/):
  - Keep subscriptions small and precise, grouped by lifetime.
  - When moving, subscribe to the new set before dropping the old one.
  - **Implication:** the client subscribes to a moving window of chunks around the player.

## Dependency upgrades (checked 2026-11-08)

| Component | Pinned | Latest | What matters |
|---|---|---|---|
| SpacetimeDB (server image, module crate, SDK, CLI) | 2.10.1 | 2.14.1 | Views with arguments from 2.13, the building block for area-of-interest views. Lower per-transaction subscription memory, also from 2.13. Module unit tests from 2.12. Rust API churn is near zero. Upgrade the server before the module (2.14 modules export an HTTP-handler entry that older hosts reject). Back up the data volume first and treat the upgrade as one-way. |
| Bevy | 0.18.1 (observer) | 0.20.1 (spike) | 0.19 and 0.20 add text input with IME, Feathers widgets (dropdown, list, number input), BSN scenes and contact shadows, and catch panics in systems. The editor is still future work. |
| bevy_egui / egui | 0.39.1 / 0.33 | 0.43.1 / 0.36 | The egui 0.35–0.36 panel API rewrite is most of the observer's upgrade effort. |
| rhai, reqwest, toml | 1.26, 0.12, 0.8 | 1.27, 0.13, 1.x | Small. reqwest renames the `rustls-tls` feature to `rustls`; rhai counts callback operations toward the operations limit. |

Order: the small crates first, then SpacetimeDB 2.14.1 across server, module, SDK and bindings, then the observer to Bevy 0.20. Afterwards the workspace builds one Bevy version again. Re-baseline the 216-character gate after the SpacetimeDB upgrade.

## Camera spike

[`living/game`](../living/game) is a throwaway prototype for choosing the camera and controls, not the start of the client's architecture. It runs as a desktop Bevy app and joins a world as a player with its own identity.

What it does:

- shows the real map in 3D;
- loads only the chunks around the player;
- offers several camera presets with live tuning;
- sends WASD movement through `human_move`, click-to-move through `goto`, and chat through `human_say`;
- shows only speech the character hears, from its own `experience` rows.

How to run it is in its [README](../living/game/README.md).
